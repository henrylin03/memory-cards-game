<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

Earn points by clicking on as many unique Pokémon cards as you can. But, if you click on the same Pokémon twice, the game ends.

Challenge yourself to try and set a new high score!

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) "Full Stack JavaScript" course. Built in ReactJS, this project focuses on practising React's `useEffect` hook for handling side effects and API calls. All Pokémon IDs, names, and images are fetched from the RESTful [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
